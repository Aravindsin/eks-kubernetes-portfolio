# Phase 1: Networking Setup (VPC + Subnets)

## Why this step?
Before deploying an EKS cluster, we need a secure and isolated network.  
A **VPC** gives us control over IP ranges, subnets, and routing.  
AWS EKS requires **at least 2 subnets across different Availability Zones** for high availability.

## What we built
- **VPC**: `10.0.0.0/16` â€” gives ~65k IPs.
- **2 Public Subnets**: For Load Balancers, NAT.
- **2 Private Subnets**: For worker nodes and Pods.
- **Internet Gateway + Route Tables**: Allow internet access for public subnets.

## Benefits
- **Security**: Worker nodes run in private subnets (not exposed to the internet).
- **Scalability**: Public subnets can host LoadBalancers to distribute traffic.
- **Flexibility**: NAT gateways can be added for private subnets to reach the internet.

## Next step
With the networking layer ready, we will create:
1. IAM roles for EKS
2. EKS Cluster inside this VPC
3. Node groups for workloads
